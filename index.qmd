We are the Ocean Predator Ecology Lab (OPEL) at the [University of Southampton's School of Ocean and Earth Science](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-ocean-and-earth-science). We do research on the ecology of marine predators.

This is our bare-bones home on the internet.
